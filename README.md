# Fast GP Mapping

All results in can be obtained by runnning the script main.m, with exception of the Monte-Carlo repetitions 
for estimating the time required to train on the bathymetry data.

These experiments can be repeated by running the script in the folder "BathymetryData" named "ProcessData" 9 times, 
and calculating an average and a standard deviation from the resulting variables "training_time" and "prediction_time".
